# Null Item

Adds a null item. For use with splitter filters, etc.

It does not appear in your crafting menu, but is available for filters. The null item signal is also available for use in the circuit network.

Uses the "no recipe" graphic from the base game.

## But why?

Inspired by [Industrial Revolution 3](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IndustrialRevolution3) that provides a similar null item (although with a custom graphic). I found it to be a satisfying and useful quality of life feature and wanted it available in a vanilla game, so I made this mod.

## Alternatives

The same effect can be achieved in vanilla by using a filter on fish or deconstruction planner.

If you want your splitters to show an explicit null symbol in alt mode, this mod is for you.
