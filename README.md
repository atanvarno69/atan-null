# Null Item

Adds a null item. For use with splitter filters, etc. It does not appear in your crafting menu, but is available for filters. The null item signal is also available for use in the circuit network.

The same effect can be achieved in vanilla by using a filter on fish or deconstruction planner. This mod is for those who want their splitters to show an explicit null symbol in alt mode.

Uses the "no recipe" graphic from the base game.

Inspired by the similar feature in [Industrial Revolution 3](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IndustrialRevolution3).
